## 🔧 Key Features

### Smart Detection
- **macOS Version**: Automatic detection of system version and build
- **Hardware Compatibility**: Detects Broadcom/Intel WiFi cards
- **SIP Status**: Analyzes System Integrity Protection state
- **Kext Dependencies**: Checks for required system kexts

### Multiple Injection Methods
1. **Direct Kext Loading**: For systems with SIP disabled
2. **Signed Kext Loading**: For systems with SIP enabled
3. **SkyLight Plugin**: Runtime injection without SIP modification

### Hardware Support
- **Broadcom WiFi**: BCM43xx, BCM4360, BCM4364, BCM4371, BCM4377, BCM4378, BCM4387
- **Intel WiFi**: Various Intel WiFi 6/6E cards
- **Architectures**: Intel x86_64 and Apple Silicon (ARM64)

### Safety Features
- **Backup Creation**: Automatic backup of original files
- **Permission Management**: Proper file ownership and permissions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error detection and reporting
- **Logging**: Detailed injection logs and reports

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Detect system and generate configuration
python3 macos26_patch_detector.py

# 2. Run injection
python3 apple_bcmwlan_injector.py

# 3. Check results
cat apple_bcmwlan_injection_report.txt
```

### Injection Methods

#### Method 1: Direct Kext Loading
```bash
sudo csrutil disable
python3 apple_bcmwlan_injector.py
sudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleBCMWLANCompanion.kext
sudo csrutil enable
```

#### Method 2: Signed Kext Loading
```bash
codesign -f -s "Your Certificate" AppleBCMWLANCompanion.kext
sudo cp -R AppleBCMWLANCompanion.kext /Library/Extensions/
sudo kextload /Library/Extensions/AppleBCMWLANCompanion.kext
```

#### Method 3: SkyLight Plugin (Recommended)
```bash
python3 apple_bcmwlan_injector.py
# Plugin handles injection automatically
```
