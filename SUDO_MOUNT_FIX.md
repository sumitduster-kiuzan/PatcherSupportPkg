# Fix for Sudo Mount Password Issue

## Problem
When mounting the Universal-Binaries.dmg in an automated environment, the `sudo mount` command fails because there's no terminal to enter the password:

```
sudo: a terminal is required to read the password; either use the -S option to read from standard input or configure an askpass helper
sudo: a password is required
```

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Configure Passwordless Sudo for Mount (Recommended)

Create a sudoers configuration file that allows the mount command without a password:

1. Create a new sudoers file:
```bash
sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/oclp-mount
```

2. Add the following line (replace `username` with your actual username):
```
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/mount, /sbin/umount, /usr/sbin/diskutil
```

3. Save and exit. Ensure the file has the correct permissions:
```bash
sudo chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/oclp-mount
```

### Solution 2: Use sudo -S Option

If the calling script can be modified, use the `-S` option to read the password from stdin:

```python
import subprocess
import getpass

password = getpass.getpass("Enter sudo password: ")
process = subprocess.Popen(
    ['sudo', '-S'] + your_mount_command,
    stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
    text=True
)
stdout, stderr = process.communicate(input=password + '\n')
```

### Solution 3: Use SUDO_ASKPASS

Set up an askpass helper program:

1. Create a script at `/usr/local/bin/askpass.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "your_password_here"
```

2. Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/askpass.sh
```

3. Set the environment variable:
```bash
export SUDO_ASKPASS=/usr/local/bin/askpass.sh
```

4. Run sudo with -A flag:
```bash
sudo -A mount ...
```

## For CI/CD Environments

In CI/CD environments, the best approach is to configure passwordless sudo for specific commands (Solution 1) to avoid security issues with storing passwords in scripts.

## Security Note

- Only grant passwordless sudo access to specific commands that are needed
- Never store passwords in plain text in scripts or configuration files
- Use the most restrictive permissions possible
